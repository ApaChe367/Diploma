2. Optimal PV Array Orientation & Production Gain:

The optimization process consistently identifies a Southeast (SE) orientation (Optimal Tilt: ~44.13째, Optimal Azimuth: ~122.45째) as preferable for maximizing annual energy production over a traditional south-facing setup.
This SE orientation results in a significant annual energy production of approximately 292,986 kWh.
A substantial Production Improvement of ~26.33% is achieved compared to a baseline south-facing configuration (38째 Tilt, 180째 Azimuth).
Validation (as discussed and confirmed by your standalone_validation.py output) indicates this gain is legitimate and primarily driven by the specific characteristics of your input solar irradiance data for Athens, which shows significantly higher Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) in the morning hours. The SE orientation is better positioned to capture this high-quality morning sunlight.
3. Energy Mismatch & Optimization Trade-offs:

The Balanced Weighted Energy Mismatch for the optimal configuration is approximately 140,837 kWh. This figure represents the sum of hourly absolute differences between generation and load, weighted by your defined factors (which consider load profile and time of day).
The Mismatch Improvement from Optimization is -6.27%. This means that while the SE orientation significantly boosts total energy production, it results in a slightly worse score on your specific weighted mismatch metric compared to the baseline south-facing system.
This outcome highlights a common trade-off in multi-objective PV system optimization: the orientation that maximizes total energy yield may not always be the one that best aligns generation with the load profile according to a specific weighting scheme. Your "balanced" solution from the Pareto front reflects one point on this trade-off curve.
4. System Performance Characteristics:

The chosen panels have a nominal STC efficiency of 14.63%.
The overall AC System Efficiency of the optimally oriented system is ~11.13%.
The Performance Ratio (PR) is ~76.04%. This PR is plausible but indicates that about 24% of the energy (relative to the STC-rated capacity and incident irradiance) is lost due to various system inefficiencies (thermal, soiling, wiring, inverter, etc.).
The System Yield is ~1444.7 kWh/kWp, and the Capacity Factor is ~16.49%, both reasonable for a system in Athens.
5. Battery System Performance:

An Optimal Battery Capacity of 51.00 kWh was determined.
This battery contributes to a Battery Self-Sufficiency Rate of ~26.13% and a Battery Self-Consumption Rate of ~84.96%.
The battery is expected to undergo approximately 353 equivalent full cycles per year, indicating intensive daily use.
The Battery Simple Payback period is ~8.85 years, which is a realistic figure for current battery economics.
6. Energy Loss Quantification:

The breakdown of annual system losses is now much more realistic:
Pre-Temperature Losses (Soiling, Shading, etc.): ~43,993 kWh
Temperature Losses: ~35,262 kWh
Inverter Losses: ~12,208 kWh
Total System Losses (sum of above): ~91,463 kWh
These figures correctly demonstrate that losses scale with the amount of energy being processed and are consistent with the overall system efficiency and PR.
7. Iterative Improvements & Validation:

Through the process, several key metrics and calculations were refined, leading to more robust and plausible results. Notably:
The definition and calculation of energy losses became more realistic.
The calculation and reporting of energy mismatch were aligned between the optimization function and the baseline comparison, resolving earlier anomalies.
The battery payback calculation was corrected to a realistic range.
The significant production gain was validated against the specific morning-dominant irradiance patterns in your input data.
Key Takeaways for Your Thesis:

Your simulation demonstrates that for the specific Athens location and the provided hourly weather data, a non-traditional Southeast PV orientation can yield significantly more annual energy than a standard south-facing setup due to prevailing morning irradiance conditions.
There's an observable trade-off between maximizing total energy production and optimizing for load matching (as measured by your weighted mismatch metric).
The project appears economically viable under the assumed financial parameters.
The detailed loss analysis now provides a clear picture of where energy is lost in the system cascade.
These conclusions are based on the outputs of your simulation and the iterative refinements we've discussed. Congratulations on developing such a comprehensive model and working through the validation stages!
