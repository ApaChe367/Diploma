The "Best Overall" Scenario Depends on the Goal:

For a purely investment-driven project, the "Maximize Production" scenario is the clear winner. Its economic returns (4.5-year payback, 22.89% IRR) are phenomenal and would be the recommended path for any commercial investor based on these results.
For a project where exporting power is prohibited or heavily penalized, the "Maximize Self-Consumption" scenario provides the blueprint, albeit at a massive cost to total energy generation and likely financial return.
For a user prioritizing energy independence, the "Maximize Self-Sufficiency" scenario provides the optimal configuration for minimizing grid imports.
Economic Results are Highly Favorable: 
SE Orientation is Consistently Confirmed: Across all high-yield scenarios, the Southeast orientation is chosen, reinforcing the conclusion that this is the best strategy for maximizing energy capture with your specific Athens weather data.

Key Findings and Interpretation
1. A Larger Battery is Economically Justified Across All High-Yield Scenarios.
A major finding is that the optimal battery size for all scenarios aiming for high production and/or self-sufficiency is 101 kWh. This is double the 51 kWh found in previous runs.

Reasoning: The more realistic economic parameters—specifically the higher electricity purchase price (€0.28/kWh) and the very low feed-in tariff (€0.055/kWh)—make storing surplus energy for later use far more valuable than exporting it for minimal revenue. The simulation correctly determined that investing in a larger battery is justified by the greater savings it generates.
2. The "Best Economics" Scenario is Now the Confirmed Financial Winner.
With complete economic data for every scenario, we can definitively say that the "Best Economics" scenario delivers the optimal financial outcome, achieving the highest NPV of €1,344,549 and an exceptional IRR of 33.97%.

Insight: Interestingly, this scenario achieves its goal not by maximizing production, but by finding a "sweet spot" with slightly less production (294.7 MWh vs. 296.5 MWh) that results in a slightly better combination of self-consumption and energy yield, proving that maximum production and maximum profit are not always synonymous.
3. The "Maximize Self-Consumption" Strategy is Now Fully Quantified.
This scenario provides a perfect case study in trade-offs. To achieve 100% self-consumption (zero export), the system design is radically different:

Low Production: It only generates 91,425 kWh, ensuring no excess.
Southwest Orientation: The 244° azimuth and steep 76° tilt are chosen to shift generation to the late afternoon, likely to match the facility's evening load profile.
Ineffective Battery: The battery payback is infinite, and it's barely used (0.4 cycles/year). This correctly shows that if there is no surplus energy, a battery provides no economic value for energy arbitrage.
Conclusion: This is a viable strategy only for situations where exporting to the grid is strictly forbidden. While still profitable (4.18-year payback), it leaves a significant amount of potential generation and profit on the table.
4. The "Best Overall" Scenario: A Clear Recommendation
Based on this final, comprehensive analysis, a clear recommendation can be made:

For any stakeholder whose primary goal is financial return on investment, the "Best Economics" scenario is the undisputed winner. It provides the highest NPV and IRR with a payback period of only 3.1 years.
The "Balanced Approach" and "Maximize Production" scenarios are extremely close runners-up, offering nearly identical financial returns. This indicates that for this project, the economic outcomes are robust across any high-yield SE orientation.
Final Opinion:

This research successfully developed and validated a multi-scenario optimization framework for a PV-battery system in Athens, yielding several critical, data-driven conclusions that challenge conventional design approaches.

Economic Viability is Exceptionally Strong: The project is not just financially viable but highly profitable under the final, realistic Greek market parameters. The "Best Economics" scenario projects an outstanding Net Present Value (NPV) of €1.34 million, an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 34.0%, and a rapid project payback period of 3.1 years. This robust return is driven by a combination of optimized energy yield and realistic, market-specific financial inputs.

A Southeast Orientation is Conclusively Optimal for Energy Yield: A key finding is that a Southeast (SE) orientation (Azimuth: ~117°-122°) consistently outperforms a traditional south-facing system. This non-traditional orientation results in a validated ~27% increase in annual energy production. This gain is legitimate and directly caused by the local weather data, which shows significantly higher Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) in the morning hours that the SE orientation is better positioned to capture.

Optimal System Design is Dictated by Strategic Goals: The scenario-based analysis proves that there is no single "best" PV system design; the optimal configuration is a direct function of the primary objective. This is most clearly illustrated by the trade-offs between:

High-Yield Strategies ("Maximize Production," "Best Economics"): These favor a SE orientation to generate ~295,000 kWh annually, leading to top-tier financial returns.
A "No-Export" Strategy ("Maximize Self-Consumption"): This results in a radically different design—a steep, Southwest orientation and much lower production (91,425 kWh)—to achieve 100% self-consumption, demonstrating a viable solution for grid-constrained applications.
A Larger Battery is Justified by Current Economics: The analysis determined that an optimal battery capacity of 101 kWh is justified for all high-yield scenarios. The combination of high on-site electricity costs (€0.28/kWh) and low export tariffs (€0.055/kWh) makes it more profitable to store surplus energy for self-consumption rather than exporting it, justifying the larger investment in storage.

System Performance and Losses are Realistically Modeled: The final model operates with a plausible Performance Ratio (PR) of ~76% and an overall System Efficiency of ~11.1%. The detailed loss analysis accurately quantifies the ~93 MWh of annual system losses, providing a clear and credible picture of the energy conversion cascade from sunlight to usable AC power.

Key Points to Touch Upon in Your Thesis Presentation
Here is a logical and compelling narrative structure for presenting these findings.

1. Introduction: The Core Question

Start by framing the problem: "This thesis moves beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to ask: How does the optimal design of a PV-battery system change when we optimize for different, often conflicting, strategic goals—from maximum profit to maximum energy independence?"
2. Methodology: A Goal-Oriented Optimization Framework

Briefly introduce the pvlib-based simulation engine.
Highlight your key innovation: the implementation of five distinct optimization scenarios ("Maximize Production," "Best Economics," etc.) that use advanced algorithms to provide tailored solutions for different stakeholder goals.
3. Key Finding #1: The SE Orientation Advantage – A Data-Driven Discovery

Present your most impactful result: the system's preference for a Southeast orientation, leading to a ~27% increase in energy production.
Immediately present the evidence: Show the validation data that proves this is caused by the significantly higher direct irradiance (DNI) in the morning hours found in your Athens weather data. This confirms the finding is legitimate and a powerful example of data-driven design.

Focus on the contrast between the "Maximize Production" strategy and the radical "Maximize Self-Consumption" strategy (high-yield SE vs. low-yield SW orientation).
Main Message: Conclude that the "best" system design is subjective. Your tool empowers stakeholders to make an informed choice by clearly showing the outcome of each strategy (e.g., "Best Economics" yields the highest NPV, while "Maximize Self-Sufficiency" minimizes grid imports).

Explain why the economics are so strong, linking it to your realistic financial inputs (high electricity price, low FiT).
Explain that these same economic conditions justify a larger 101 kWh battery, as storing energy is now more profitable than exporting it.
